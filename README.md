# TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker

#About
Tiny application which checks for NVIDIA GPU drivers at each startup, developed in C# for Windows.
I know that this application is in its early state but I'm trying really hard to get it done.

Instead of using GeForce Experience you can use this tiny application which will be highly customizable, secure and easy to use.

#Help me out
The only real issue I currently have is a way to get the latest version available from the NVIDIA servers, if you're interested in helping me out I'd be greatful for anything. There's a seperate issue on this; #1.

#Command line arguments:
`-quiet`: no ui.

#Requirements
+ .NET Framework 4.6 (to be changed)
+ Stable internet connection

#License
TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker - tiny application which checks for GPU drivers daily.
