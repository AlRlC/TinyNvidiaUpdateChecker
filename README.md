# TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker

#About
Tiny application which checks for NVIDIA GPU drivers, developed in C# for Windows.

Instead of using GeForce Experience you can use this tiny application which will be highly customizable, secure and easy to use.
It searches for NVIDIA GPU drivers exactly like GeForce Experience does but in a lightweight (and open source) application. 

When you install GeForce Experience a lot of extra services are being installed without you knowing, and we have no clue what the executables does in the background when the application isn't even used.
Not only that but GeForce Experience is really slow and I don't want to maunally go to their website to check for updates.

I know that this application is in its early state but I'm trying really hard to get it done.

#Download
You can now download a pre-alpha build now!
It has some restrictions, it can only detect local GPU driver version and not check for updates from NVIDIA servers.

#Command line arguments
`-quiet`: no ui.

#Requirements
+ .NET Framework 4
+ Windows 10, 8.1, 8 or Vista
+ Stable internet connection

#License
TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker - tiny application which checks for GPU drivers daily.
